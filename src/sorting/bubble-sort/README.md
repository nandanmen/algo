> Problem from [hackerrank/ctci-bubble-sort](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-bubble-sort/problem)

Given an array of integers, sort the array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. Once sorted, print the following lines:

1. `Array is sorted in {numSwaps} swaps.` where `numSwaps` is the number of swaps that took place.
2. `First Element: {firstElement}` where `firstElement` is the first element of the sorted array.
3. `Last Element: {lastElement}` where `lastElement` is the last element of the sorted array.
