# @narendras/algo

Collection of solutions for various algorithmic challenges, with explanations and playground.

## What's in the box?

Each algorithm problem is categorized by the data structure that it is concerned with. This categorization is based on wherever I got the original problem from.

```
[src]
└── [category]
    └── [problem-name]
        ├── README.md
        ├── index.js
        └── [problem-name].test.js
```

Inside a problem's folder:

- `index.js` &mdash; The file containing the solution itself.
- `[problem name].test.js` &mdash; Tests for the problem.
- `README.md` &mdash; The problem description and links to the original problem.

## Running the Solutions

Running `alg <problem name> <input>` allows you to test my solution with your own custom inputs directly on the command line.

> This is also documented in each problem's `README.md`.
